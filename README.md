# Binary_Classification_for_AWID
I used AWID dataset, AWID-CLS-R-Trn for training and AWID-CLS-R-Tst for testing puposes.
It has multiple classes: normal, injection, impersonation and flodding attack types.

I made it a binary classification by making two classes: normal or attack(represent injection, impersonation and flooding attack)
instead of using four classes(which is multi-class classification)
And,I used dense neural network and RNN with LSTM against the dataset to observe the differences in result with multi-class.
