# Binary_Classification_for_AWID
I used AWID dataset, AWID-CLS-R-Trn for training and AWID-CLS-R-Tst for testing puposes.
It has multiple classes: Normal, injection, impersonation and flodding attack types.

I made it a binary classification by making normal or attack(represent injection, impersonation and flooding attack)
And,I used dense neural network and RNN with LSTM against the dataset to observe the differences in result with multi-class.
